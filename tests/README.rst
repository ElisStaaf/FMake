Fmake: Tests
============
This directory has been specifically made for tests, since
I got tired of redoing my test enviroment all of the time.

Instructions
------------
You can modify this test directory *almost* completely freely.
Just make sure you don't delete some other test. Just make sure
that the application prints:

::

   [INFO]: FMake compilation succeded. All tests pass!

Yeah, so enjoy the test eviroment, I guess..?
